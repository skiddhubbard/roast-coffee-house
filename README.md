##ROAST COFFEE HOUSE

Roast Coffee House is a web design project that I completed as part of the Skillcrush Visual Designer Blueprint. After 
completing the design, I continued by developing the site. This was the first site that I developed using Flexbox and Parallax
scrolling. [Here it is!](https://cdn.rawgit.com/skiddhubbard/roast-coffee-house/master/index.html)
